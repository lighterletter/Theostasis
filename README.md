# Theostasis
A javascript three-dimensional application.

## Intro

The objective of the game is simple. A minimalistic sandbox where the user can play with an assortment of floating cubes, turn the gravity on/off and/or reset the canvas at their will. 

The game randomizes the color and position of elements on the canvas creating a dynamic and interesting sense
of space. The user can grab and hold, or throw the cubes that randomly generate each time the game is reset. 
The application can be mounted to a single touch display as a piece of interactive art, or played with with the mouse. 

## Instructions

*Click and hold to drag the boxes
*Use the black button to toggle the gravity. 
*Use the white button to reset the canvas.
 

## Set-UP

Unless you know how to set up your own server, use a program like **MAMP** that helps you set up a local server. 

For MAMP, Installation is simple. 

	Open your MAMP folder and drop Theostasis into 'htdocs'. 
	Make sure your server is running by opening MAMP as an application and clicking start on the server. Then 		simply go into your browser (I recommend google Chrome) and type localhost:8888 on the address bar(default 	MAMP port). You should then see a link with the application name on it. Click that and you're done. Enjoy.

## Code 

All libraries are wired in 
**index.html** 

With a text editor like SublimeText there are a couple of simple ways in which you can customize your experience.
I've written it in the code. Feel free to ask questions.

#### Some interesting things to try: 
	*Change gravity's effect on the cubes. 
	*I've added and commented out a timer which you can turn on by simply un-commenting the denoted section.
	*Different lighting and fog parameters.
	*Changing the values for the Sphere's wireframes can create some interesting effects.
